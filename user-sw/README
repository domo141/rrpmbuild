Quick commit to add handling of rpm packages in non-rootspace, e.g.
under one's $HOME/.local[/share]/user-sw/ ...

... but since the path is somewhat significant the examples here
use /home/user-sw/ as "usw root dir".

One can tar the required files by running ./tar-mkusw.sh '!'
- that creates an archive named user-sw-yyyymmdd-hhmm.tar.xz
  which then can me copied to some other host, extract there
  and continue along the following lines:

$ sudo mkdir /home/user-sw/
$ sudo chown $USER:$USER /home/user-sw/
$ ./mk-usw.sh /home/user-sw

That creates:
  /home/user-sw/var/lib/rpm/*
  /home/user-sw/var/cache/rpm/user-sw-1-1.usw51.noarch.rpm
  /home/user-sw/bin/rpmpeek.pl
  /home/user-sw/bin/rrpmbuild.pl
  /home/user-sw/bin/usw

Note, the '51' part in user-sw-1-1.usw51.noarch.rpm comes from
the first 2 octets of; printf %s /home/user-sw | sha256sum

The idea there is that all pkgs with .usw51. in its name will
install everything under that hierarchy (*). The commands
`usw rpmi`, `usw rpmu` and `usw spec` commands enforce or help
achieving that.

(*) it's 1/256 than some other get the same (and if one chose 16
    random paths, there would 50% chance for any 2 of those to
    collide there) if that happened it would be funny coincidence :D

Run; /home/user-sw/bin/usw ;: to see what commands `usw` provides...

Then either add /home/user-sw/bin/ to PATH, or symlink commands
from there to some other path in system
(I just did ; ln -sf /home/user-sw/bin/usw ~/bin ;: and I have to
 keep doing that to dogfood keeping it functional)

If one chose another dir, e.g. in my case /home/too/.local/share/user-sw/.
I got *.usw77.* as an "identifier". Installation showed that /./ in paths
(e.g. /home/too/.local/share/user-sw/./tmp) but final ..././bin/usw had
that removed -- `realpath -s` is used to make absolute, cleaned up path,
but symbolic links *not* resolved -- one may need to have the final
directory referenced via symbolic link, and it is user's responsibility
to make it working should there be symlink in place (like in any other
case).
